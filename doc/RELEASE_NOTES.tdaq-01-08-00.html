The documentation for config and generated DAL package has been updated. Now it 
is generated by DoxyGen tool and available from the release installation, see
<a href="http://pcatd12.cern.ch/doxygen/tdaq-01-08-00/html/ConfigPackages.html">
ConfigPackages</a> page.<h4>C++ Changes</h4>
<p>The utilization of attribute converters is moved on the level of config 
package from the <a href="#dal">dal</a> packages. This reduces size of generated 
code, improves performance (only one conversion is performed per database object 
instead of multiple conversions for each generated DAL object instantiated from 
it) and allows to use converted values from the config layer without explicitly 
invoked converters (e.g. by test manager and RCD packages).</p>
<p>Add new method <strong>test_object()</strong> to the Configuration class. The 
method tests existence of object by class name and object ID, and returns true, 
if the object was found and false otherwise. This method duplicates 
functionality of similar <strong>get()</strong> method. The difference is the 
new method does not throw daq::config::NotFound exception if the object is not 
found, since the Python config interface has problems catching ERS exceptions.</p>
<h4>Java Changes</h4>
<p>Add new methods to get inheritance hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>TreeMap&lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; superclasses() - get names of 
	superclasses for each database class</li>
	<li>TreeMap&lt;String, TreeSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; subclasses() - get names of subclasses 
	for database classes having them</li>
</ul>
<h4>New: Python Interfaces to Configuration and ConfigObject classes. These binding were 
made to be quite "pythonic", which means that their function calls were changed to cope with Python interafce.</h4>
