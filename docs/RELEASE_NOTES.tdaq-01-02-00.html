<h4><a name="config-stats">Statistics on template objects</a></h4>
<p>The mechanism to get statistics information on generated DAL's objects
created by user process has been implemented. When the ::Configuration object is
destroyed, it prints out information about read object's references, full
objects and numbers of client cache hits. This only works, if the user defines
environment variable TDAQ_DUMP_CONFIG_PROFILER_INFO.</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>Below there is example, which demonstrates how to use and to interpreter the
profiling:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>bash$ export TDAQ_DUMP_CONFIG_PROFILER_INFO=1
bash$ dal_dump_apps --oks -d daq/partitions/lxplus_tests.data.xml -p onlsw_test_3x3_lxlpus -a 'lxplus-3x3-33 ctrl
...
<font color="#000080">Configuration profiler report:
number of created template objects: 152
number of read template objects: 22
number of cache hits: 160</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>number of created template objects</i> shows how many references on
the database objects were created inside user process. Note, creation of
references does not mean the database object was read and this is relatively inexpensive
operation from performance point of view. By default the values of an object's
attributes and relationships are read, when they are accessed explicitly by
user's code.</p>
<p>The <i>number of read template objects </i>indicates how many objects were
actually read because user's code accessed value of an attribute or a
relationship. It is desirable to reduce such number as much is possible to gain
a performance.</p>
<p>The <i>number of cache hits </i>shows client cache effectiveness. This means
a requested object has been taken from user's application cache instead of
database.</p>
<h4>Database loading</h4>
<p>Add new environment variable TDAQ_DB_NAME, which has higher priority than
TDAQ_DB_DATA to define name of the database to be loaded. It is a temporal
solution to allow multiple RDB servers used inside single partition. If RDB
implementation is used, <b>it is necessary to define TDAQ_DB_NAME environment
variable at the partition level and to set it's value to the &quot;RDB&quot;</b>
since it is required by the TDAQ setup (e.g. see partition <i>be_test</i> from <i>daq/partitions/be_test.data.xml</i>
as example).</p>
<p>If parameter of the <i>Configuration::load() </i>method is empty, then it
uses one of above environment variables to load database. It is requested by the
Control WG to allow DSA supervisor to re-load a database without knowing it's
exact name.</p>
